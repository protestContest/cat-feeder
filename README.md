# Super Cat Feeder Extreme

This is the arduino sketch that controls my automatic cat feeder. I'll upload
photos and schematics later.

My cat gets fed twice a day. The arduino reads a pot to see how much food to
give, then turns a motor for that length of time.

Requires the Time and TimeAlarms libraries.
